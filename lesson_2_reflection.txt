What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    It sets up the configuration files so git can start tracking things

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    There can be things in the working directory that haven't been added to the
    staging area or repository. It is like a loading area for the repository so
    you can add in files to the repo

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

    You can add the file(s) for each commit to the staging area and then commit
    before adding files for the next commit, etc.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

    If you want multiple working versions or if you want to experiment with
    a new feature, then new branches can help you do that.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

    They let you know at what point different branches popped up

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

    Merging combines the changes from both branches. The diagram shows the
    branches coming together to show that they are now the same branch.

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

    Automatic merging is quick and easy. Manual merging makes sure you get
    exactly what you want, but takes time. When there are conflicts, manually
    merging is the only option.
