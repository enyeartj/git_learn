To cache your github password in git:
    https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/

Check remote repositorites current repo is linked to:
    git remote

Add a new remote repository after you make it on github:
    git remote add <remote_name> <remote_url>
    (remote_name is usually "origin")

Get verbose information (push and fetch) on remotes:
    git remote -v

Push a branch to the remote (just going to call it "origin" from now on):
    git push origin <branch_name>
